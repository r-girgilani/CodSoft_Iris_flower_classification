# CodSoft_Iris_flower_classification

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements using machine learning techniques.

Key Libraries: numpy, pandas, sklearn.cluster.KMeans, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn

Dataset: The iris dataset, containing sepal and petal measurements along with species information, was utilized.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The dataset was loaded, encoded, and explored for missing values and descriptive statistics.

Data Visualization: 3D and 2D scatter plots were created to visualize relationships between features and species.

K-Means Clustering: The Elbow Technique was applied to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) for the KMeans algorithm. Then, K-Means clustering was applied to the dataset.

Accuracy Measure: The confusion matrix was computed to evaluate the accuracy of the clustering results.
